#Estimation of Hours Spent on the project
1. I spent around 11 hours approximately on the project.

#Testing of the code
1. Initially I started the testing on my PC's terminal.
2. Later on I wrote test cases in the format specified in description, and used the test harness to run the tests and capturing the output, to compare with the expected out in the corresponding .out files for the test.

#Unresolved Bugs or Issues
1. It was working fine earlier, but now I am facing an issue where I am pushing my code on github for the github actions, github is unable to capture output from the subprocess command i.e, the stdout from command line, therefore, however it works fine on my local pc, so I believe, it is an environment related issue.
